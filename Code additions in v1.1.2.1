Code additions. Working in v1.1.2 which is continuation of v1.1.1

Config file:
#define ADC_INPUT2 39

Mesure electricity file:
extern EnergyMonitor emon2;
extern unsigned short measurements2[];

double amps2 = emon2.calcIrms(1480);
double watts2 = amps2 * HOME_VOLTAGE;
measurements2[measureIndex] = watts2;

!!!!Remeber also to trace and change following lines
gDisplayValues.amps = amps1;
gDisplayValues.watt = watts1;
(I beleive this would ensure serial monitor displays messages from both sensors). Firstly trace back for a "placeholder message"

Main.ccp
EnergyMonitor emon2;
unsigned short measurements2[LOCAL_MEASUREMENTS];
emon2.current(ADC_INPUT2, 29);

??? THis part is not covered by GPT
// Setup the ADC
  adc1_config_channel_atten(ADC1_CHANNEL_0, ADC_ATTEN_DB_11);
  analogReadResolution(ADC_BITS);
  pinMode(ADC_INPUT1, INPUT);


mqtt-aws.h
extern unsigned short measurements2[];
char msg2[AWS_MAX_MSG_SIZE_BYTES];
strcpy(msg2, "{\"readings2\":[");

        for (short i = 0; i < LOCAL_MEASUREMENTS-1; i++){
            strcat(msg2, String(measurements2[i]).c_str());
            strcat(msg2, ",");
        }


Result: 
+ code compiled and build successfuly
+ serial monitor displays readings from sensor 2 successfully
+ MQTT message contains only readings ( for this stage this is ok). last lines of MQTT file needs to be adjusted.
